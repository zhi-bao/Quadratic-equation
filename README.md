# Quadratic-equation
A python's script will be helpfull to solve a quadratic equation
# How the program works ?
The program will takes three values which are a,b and c, then it determines Delta value
to know if the equation accept two solution or just one or doesn't accept any solution
# The Delta value

We say the equation doesn't accept any solution when Delta less than zero.
But if Delta equal zero we can get just one solution wich's x = -b / 2*a.
Finally if Delta greater than zero, so the equation accept two solutions
which are x= -b (-+) square root of delta / 2*a
